        <p class="body">Hello, I currently am a substite teacher for Morgan Hunt Education and respit care provider for the Down Syndrom Community in the Kansas City area.
            I have a Bachelor's degree in Speech Pathology and have been working in the academic environment with students ages 3-14 for 8+ years.
            My wonderful husband, Chad and I are huge gamers. We enjoy board games such as, 7 Woners, Gloomhaven and Terriforming Mars as well as online games by Blizzard Entertainment.
            I love games so much, I wanted to learn more about making them. So, with no background in technology or coding, I began the KU coding bootcamp to learn more. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I look forward to all the new developer skills I will gain in the program and am ready to put in the hard work.
